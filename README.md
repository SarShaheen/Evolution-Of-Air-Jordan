### Git & Github

I used GitPod as a IDE and local repository & GitHub as a remote repository. The process was as follows:
- I created a new repository on GitHub.
- Then, i had opened that repository on GitPod and started coding.
- In GitPod i had created the folders and pages.
- I then started saving my work and pushing it to the GitHub repository to keep it safe.
- The process for saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository was to (done in terminal): 
  - `git add . ` for adding work to git.
  - `git commit -m "Commit message" ` to commit the work on the stage.
  - `git push ` to push work up to GitHub.
