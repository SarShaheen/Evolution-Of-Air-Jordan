## Testing

I have tested this website in different browsers to ensure it works with Chrome,Safari etc...

I have ensured  this project is responsive and functional on all screen sizes by using devtools toolbar.

I confirm that the all text throughout the site is visable and the links are accessible to users. 

I have made sure that the sign up form will only submit once vaild details are entered.



### Bugs

I ran into a problem where the first media query for the sneakers page was not running but after looking through the code, i realised that i was missing the closing bracket. After adding it, the code ran smoothly.
